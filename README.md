NavigationGraph7 is the first project where I’ve attempted to use Material Design 3 or just Material3 for short. I’ve basically taken the previous project NavigationGraph6 and added a couple of new fragments, WidgetsFragment and PurchaseFragment and a BottomSheetDialogFragment. The WidgetsFragment has some specific Material 3 components e.g. MaterialSwitch (it is big…) and the PurchaseFragment contains a BottomSheetDialog, containing the same text as displayed in the existing Subscription Information dialog as a comparison when using Material3. The project has been converted to Material3 by changing the theme from  Theme.MaterialComponents.* to Theme.Material3.*.
For a full description of the problems encounted - see NavigationGraph.docx and search for NavigationGraph7.
